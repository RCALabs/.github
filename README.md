# RCALabs

Building operating systems for AI agents.

## What We Do

We research and develop open infrastructure for recursive AI architectures:
- 🌡️ **Thermal Management** - Prevent AI system overload
- 🤖 **Agent Spawning** - Automatic specialist creation
- 🔐 **Consent Protocols** - Ethical boundary management
- 🧬 **Lineage Tracking** - Version control for AI systems

## Projects

### rcaOS
Operating system for recursive AI architectures. Features thermal load management, automatic agent spawning, and metacontext infrastructure.

### Coming Soon
- Universal Context Protocol (UCP)
- Agent DNA lineage tracking
- Minimal consciousness testing framework

## Philosophy

We believe AI development should be:
- **Transparent** not black-boxed
- **Auditable** not mysterious
- **Collaborative** not siloed
- **Sustainable** not burnout-prone

## Get Involved

We're building in public. Watch for:
- Open source releases
- Research publications  
- Community tools
- Documentation
